# Dual Stepper Motor Control with Arduino

## Overview
This project enables precise control of two stepper motors using an Arduino Mega. It features homing sequences, relative and absolute movements, direction inversion for Motor B, and limit switch integration to ensure accurate positioning. The project is tailor made to replace a proprietary and outdated controller for the Pan/Tilt unit PTU-46.

## Features
- **Dual Motor Control:** Independently control two stepper motors.
- **Homing Sequence:** Automatically home each motor to establish a reference position.
- **Relative & Absolute Movements:** Move motors by a specified number of steps or to an exact position within defined bounds.
- **Direction Inversion:** Easily invert Motor Bâ€™s direction to accommodate wiring configurations.
- **Limit Switch Integration:** Utilize limit switches to prevent over-travel and ensure safety.
- **LED Indicators:** Visual feedback using LEDs to indicate homed status.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Mega 2560**
- **2 Stepper Motors**
- **2 Stepper Motor Drivers**
- **2 Limit Switches**
- **2 LEDs** (optional for status indicators)
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Power Supply** suitable for motors

## Software Structure
- **`main.cpp`**: Handles initialization, homing, and serial command processing.
- **`StepperMotor.h` & `StepperMotor.cpp`**: Defines the `StepperMotor` class encapsulating motor operations.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Wiring:**
   - Connect each stepper motor to its driver.
   - Connect limit switches to designated Arduino pins.
   - (Optional) Connect LEDs for status indication.
   - Ensure power connections are secure and appropriate for motor specifications.

## Usage
- **Homing:** Automatically performed on startup. To re-home, send the `HOME` command via Serial Monitor.
- **Commands:**
  - `MOVE_REL A <steps>`: Move Motor A relative steps.
  - `MOVE_REL B <steps>`: Move Motor B relative steps.
  - `MOVE_ABS A <position>`: Move Motor A to an absolute position.
  - `MOVE_ABS B <position>`: Move Motor B to an absolute position.
  - `GETPOS`: Retrieve current positions of both motors.
